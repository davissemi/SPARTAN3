These are Verilog projects targeting the Spartan3 FPGA by Xilinx.  The development board used is the Elbert 2 from Numato Labs.  Included are the Verilog source file(s), the testbench and user constraints for the Elbert 2.  Some of the projects are general enough to be easily moved to other FPGA platforms.

The purpose of this repo is to be a source of working Verilog examples to aid in learning the HDL by doing.
